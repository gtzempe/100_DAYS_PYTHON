- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, design patterns
- **Web Development**: Flask/Django frameworks, REST APIs
- **Data Handling**: File I/O, JSON, CSV processing
- **External Libraries**: Requests, pandas, automation tools
- **Projects**: Full-stack applications combining frontend and Python backends

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Flask / Django
- SQLAlchemy / PostgreSQL
- Git version control

## Background

Junior Full-Stack Developer with production experience in MERN stack (Tech-eShop e-commerce platform).
